# Rule-Engine-with-AST-Visualization

This project is a web-based rule engine that allows users to:

- Create complex rules using a custom rule language.
- Visualize the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the rules.
- Evaluate rules against user data.
- Modify existing rules.
- Store and retrieve rules from a database.



Features:
Rule Creation: Input complex rules with logical operators (AND, OR, NOT), comparison operators (>, <, =, >=, <=), and parentheses.
AST Visualization: Visualize the AST of the created rule using D3.js.
Rule Evaluation: Evaluate the rule against user-provided data.
Rule Modification: Modify existing rules by adding or removing conditions.
Rule Storage: Store and retrieve rules from an SQLite database.
